# OKupid---Date-a-Scientist
This project analyzes data from on-line dating application OKCupid. In recent years, there has been a massive rise in the usage of dating apps to find love. Many of these apps use sophisticated data science techniques to recommend possible matches to users and to optimize the user experience. These apps give us access to a wealth of information that we've never had before about how different people experience romance.  The goal of this project is to scope, prep, analyze, and create machine learning models to solve a question.

The goal of this project is to apply machine learning techniques to a data set. The primary research question that will be answered is whether an OkCupid's user astrological sign can be predicted using other variables from their profiles. This project is important since many users find astrological signs an important part of matches, and if users don't input their sign, OkCupid would like to predict which sign they might be.
